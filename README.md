# Data Mining Homework #2 - Implementing KNN with Images
In this project we will organize and extract features from images for use with our implemented KNN algorithm. The functions necessary for the project to run are located in their respective files and folders.

Disclaimer:
Our images for use in our algorithm were taken from [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
